# Digital-Logic-Design
This repository contains the .circ files of many basic Digital Logic Circuits. 
All the circuits are built in logisim 2.7.1 except the Universal Shift Register circuit, which is built in logisim-evolution.
The circuits are simulated in logisim 2.7.1 and all the results are verified.
